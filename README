This is a simple benchmark for different priority queue implementations.

All test are invoked like: `./c-heap [size] [count]`.
`count` random elements are pushed through priority queue, which max size is, well, `size`.
At `size` >= `count` case, this is, essentially, a heap sort.

To build&run the tests, just do `make`.
